The purpose of this project is to create a web application which will enable the legal heirs
to track possession of a common inherited house, its rooms and common areas and also
enable their visitors to interact with the system to manage the state of the house like
expenses, heirs payments towards the expenses and condition of the house.
Motivation for this project lies in the fact that before the introduction of web technology,
house management work was done manually with a lot of paper work involved. Papers
can easily get damaged or get lost leading to loss of data. It is also expensive to keep on
buying files to store your records. Getting a certain file to check data from many files
becomes a difficult task. Data security is not assured which can be a major concern for
many clients.
Considering these facts, developing a house management/Occupancy Tracking system
for an inherited house that can solve all the problems experienced with a manual system
or localized system makes sense. The system is to be developed in such manner that it
provides maximum user-friendly interface as the end users will be na√Øve computer users.
The system allows all types of user roles i.e. admins, heirs and their
visitors to register and login. The Heirs to the House can Login as owners, and their Guests can login
only under an Owner.
Once the user logs in, the system automatically shows
options how you interact based on your user role: The functionalities will include
updating and deleting the already registered users, heirs and visitors linked to an heir. The
users will also be able to make a reservation, update and delete previously made
reservations for a period and occupants. Heirs and their visitors should be able to register,
update and delete house expenses. The application should also allow the heirs to register,
update and delete their share of payments towards the house. As the visitors will mostly
be occupying the house, the application should allow them to update and delete the
condition of the house before and after their stay which will allow house owners to take
up necessary steps to maintain the condition of the house.
Guests can create, update and delete Expenses. Owners can create, update and delete his own expenses, 
and the owner can make Payments.
The database stores information about the users, their login credentials and their roles.
The database will mainly hold the reservation details. It also stores information about
the financial transactions made by the heirs, the expenses incurred and the state of the
house as registered by the users of the house.
